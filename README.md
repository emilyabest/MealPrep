# MealPrep

MealPrep is a capstone idea I am developing for next year. It is a meal prep application designed for college students in The United States.

The largest barriers to college students maintaining a healthy diet include time, money, and access to healthy food. This app focuses on those problems specifically as they relate to college students living in traditional dorms and apartments. Some of its features include:
- easy, inexpensive recipes that can be prepared and stored for future meals
- allocating time on the user's calendar for cooking/clean up and grocery shopping
- meal prep options for students who eat from university cafeterias
- coupon collection and alerts from local grocery stores, particularly with the user's most purchased items
- recognizing available ingredients from a picture and suggesting meals the user can prepare with the given ingredients
